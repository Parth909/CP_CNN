I will admit whether they are original cartoons or CGI, Disney's G-Rated are typically nothing but lame "sweet" crap. The story was lame, and (even worse) the movie had terrible music through all of it. The Lion King is one Disney movie that I saw when it first came out, and it proved this very well in 1994. The whole movie is simply telling kids to be brave and do what you're told. The memories of having to watch this movie will simply give you nightmares. Just watch something like the original 60's "Flintstones" cartoons instead, they were much more entertaining than "The Lion King".
